Lip sync


At 00:09:02 of the video a slide is shown, where the speaker's face cannot be seen.
In order for the inference to work, face must be detected in all the frames.
ValueError: Face not detected! Ensure the video contains a face in all the frames.

Hence, editing the video and trimming it till 00:09:1, so that it satisfies the requirements.

Same goes with the audio. It's been trimmed to 00:09:1

The model is trained on low quality video and hence works best on low quality videos. Which means that the video needed to be compressed and cropped.
Video quality is at 480p now.


Number of frames available for inference: 228

Variations

1. Resize_factor : A slight improvement can be seen.
2. Padding : Small degree of improvement can be noticed when playing around with the padding parameters.
